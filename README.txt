This repository contains all of my modpacks that use MPUC.

If a branch has a generic name like "Fabric-x.xx.x", it includes client-side-only mods that you can play with on vanilla servers.
If a branch has a unique name, it contains server-side mods designed to be played on a server with the same mods or in singleplayer.
